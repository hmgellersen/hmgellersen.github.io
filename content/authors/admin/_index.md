## About Me:

I am a cognitive neuroscientist focusing on 1) understanding the effects of healthy ageing on memory and 2) identifying preclinical signatures of Alzheimer’s disease pathology as they manifest in changes to functional brain networks and cognition. This involves the design of new memory tests, behavioural modelling, and longitudinal approaches to Alzheimer’s disease risk in large cohort studies focusing on functional neuroimaging and the earliest cognitive changes associated with the disease. In collaboration with both industry and healthcare providers, the translational aim of my work is to evaluate the potential of novel digital memory tests as a more sensitive and easily deployable test for the detection of early cognitive decline. Furthermore, I am dedicated to promoting open science and representing the interests of early career researchers by serving on professional committees, and have worked as a researcher in industry and science policy. I have also written two popular science books with Dr Gareth Moore: _Memory Palace Master_ and _The Brain Fitness Puzzle Book_ (both published by Michael O'Mara Books).
